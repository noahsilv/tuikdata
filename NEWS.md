# tuikr 0.2.0

## Breaking changes

* `statistical_data()` now returns cleaned long-form SDMX output with invariant
  dimensions removed and `*_label` columns added when code-list labels are
  available.
* The statistical portal helpers now center the SDMX-first workflow:
  `statistical_tables()` exposes `node_type`, `dataflow_id`, and `table_url`,
  while `statistical_resources()` exposes `resource_type` and `resource_url`.

## New features

* Added `statistical_data()` support for localized SDMX labels through
  `lang = "en"` and `lang = "tr"`.
* Added a focused geographic mapping vignette and refreshed the getting-started
  guide to match the current statistical and geographic APIs.
* Added coverage for vignette accessibility so required figure alt text is
  exercised in tests.

## Fixes

* Tightened scalar argument validation in `geo_data()` and `geo_map()` so
  vector, missing, and `NA` inputs fail with package errors instead of base-R
  condition errors.
* Cleaned `R CMD check` notes related to NSE imports and outdated public links.
* Fixed a tidyselect deprecation warning in `geo_map()`.
* Refreshed README examples, package metadata, and pkgdown-facing links to
  match the rewritten SDMX and geographic interfaces.

## Infrastructure

* Refreshed generated documentation and pkgdown content for the current API.
* Added build ignore coverage for local planning artifacts.
